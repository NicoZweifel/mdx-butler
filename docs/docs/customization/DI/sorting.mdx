description: Change how sorting is handled
---

The sort order can be customized by passing a `SortProvider`.

<Info>
  To get full control over how sorting is handled, it is possible to inject a
  custom `SortProvider`.
</Info>

```ts {4} showLineNumbers
return docs({
  // other options
  sortProvider: (/*params*/) => {
    // implementation
  },
});
```

<Success>
  By default, documents are sorted alphabetically by their path.
</Success>

```ts
export type SortProvider<
  T extends { frontmatter: UnknownFrontMatter } = {
    frontmatter: UnknownFrontMatter;
  },
> = (pages: T[]) => T[];
```
