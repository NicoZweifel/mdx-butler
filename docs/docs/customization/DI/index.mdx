description: Inject dependencies

Similar to how `remark` and `rehype` plugins and other options can be passed you can also inject your own implementations instead of the existing ones.

<Warning>
  Changing any of these potentially requires updating components as well.
</Warning>

Please feel free to replace existing implementations like the following:

- [`Frontmatter`](/customization/DI/frontmatter)
- [`Sorting`](/customization/DI/sorting)
- [`Table of contents`](/customization/DI/tableOfContents)
- [`FileProvider`](/customization/DI/fileProvider)

<Success>
  Contributions to the existing implementations are always welcome!
</Success>
